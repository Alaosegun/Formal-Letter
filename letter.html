    <h4><strong>RE: Eilen Dover University Apllication</strong></h4>
   <br>
   <strong>Dear Eileen,</strong> 

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awsome's science Faculty to study as part of your phD next year.I will answer your questuions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<br>
     <strong>Starting Dates</strong>
     <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beggining of a semester, 8the start dates for each one are as folows:</p>

     <ul>
         <li>First semester: 9 September 2023</li>
         <li>Second semester: 15 January 2023 </li>
         <li>Third semester: 2 May 2023</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer</p>

     <p>You can find more information about <a href=""> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

     <h3>Subjects of Study</h3>
     <p>At the Awsome Science Faculty, we have a prett open-minded facility-as long as the subjects fall somwhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you sub,itted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

     <ol>
         <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
         <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="Hyper Text markup Language ">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascadind Stylesheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h3><strong>Exotic Dance Moves</strong></h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, <em>I did study exotic tribal dances.</em> To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestocks to be <q>fruitful</q> </dd>
    <br>

        <dt>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
         <br>

        <dt>Artic Robot Dance</dt>
      <dd> An intresting example of historic misinformtion, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Nothern Alaska and Canda. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this becauswe they were really cold.</dd>
